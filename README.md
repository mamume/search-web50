# Search
  A front-end design for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

## Specification
- **Pages**. The website has three pages: one for Google Search, one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.
  - On the Google Search page, there are links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there is a link in the upper-right to go back to Google Search.
- **Query Text**. On the Google Search page, the user is able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page.
  - Like Google’s own, search bar is centered with rounded corners. The search button is also centered, and beneath the search bar.
- **Query Images**. On the Google Image Search page, the user is able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.
- **Query Advanced**. On the Google Advanced Search page, the user is able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own [advanced search](https://www.google.com/advanced_search) options)
  - Find pages with… “all these words:”
  - Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
  - Find pages with… “any of these words:”
  - Find pages with… “none of these words:”
- **Appearance**. Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options are stacked vertically, and all of the text fields are left aligned.
  - Consistent with Google’s own CSS, the “Advanced Search” button is blue with white text. When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, the user is taken to search results page for their given query.
- **Lucky**. Added an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link takes users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
- **Aesthetics**. The CSS matches Google’s own aesthetics as best as possible.
